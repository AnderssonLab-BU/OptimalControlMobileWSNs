Time Optimal Control for Data Harvesting in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (2024)

Paper Abstract - 
We consider the problem of finding an optimal
trajectory of a single agent tasked with harvesting data
from multiple mobile sensor nodes in a wireless sensor
network. We describe the data transmission model using
a free-space broadcast communication scheme and formulate
an optimal control problem to extract the data from all
the nodes in minimal time. In a one-dimensional mission
space, we demonstrate that the optimal motion strategy can
be expressed in parametric form. Within this strategy, the
agentâ€™s motion is determined by a sequence of two modes,
alternating between full-speed travel and a motion derived
from a parametric convex combination function of sensor
velocities. We present two approaches for solving the parametric
optimal control problem, a gradient-descent-based
scheme and a heuristic search method. The effectiveness
of these methods is validated through simulations.
